# üö¢ Battleship

Welcome to **Battleship**, a Python project designed to review and practice fundamental programming concepts by simulating the classic game of Battleship! This project covers:

- **Conditional Statements**
- **Loops**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **File Handling (Txt Files)**
- **Libraries** (`random`, `os`, `shutil`)
- **Functions**

## üéÆ Rules

This is a **single-player mode** where you play against the console. Here's how it works:

1. **Place Your Fleet**:
   - You can place a **boat**, a **submarine**, and a **destroyer** on a **10x10 grid** by specifying the coordinates.
   - Each ship has a specific size:
     - Boat: 2 cells
     - Submarine: 3 cells
     - Destroyer: 4 cells

2. **Strike the Enemy**:
   - Once your fleet is placed, you can choose coordinates to strike the console's fleet.
   - The console will also take turns to strike your fleet.

3. **Win the Game**:
   - The game ends when either you or the console sinks the other's entire fleet.
